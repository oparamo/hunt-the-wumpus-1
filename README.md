Hunt-the-Wumpus
===============

My first video game. Used C#, Visual Studio, and XNA for my Intro to Video Game Programming class. You are placed randomly somewhere in the map and must hunt the Wumpus with your crooked arrow. This is a console based version of Hunt the Wumpus. I didn't get to finish it so it's a little broken.

To run this game you need XNA 4 installed along with Microsoft Visual Studio 4. Open the project in Visual Studio and make a build.
